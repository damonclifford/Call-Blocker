Call-Blocker
============

Blacklists/Whitelists Numbers 

This was an app that my teammate and I developed within 3 hours at a hackathon and won first prize!

Its a call manager app.
You have a list of whitelisted numbers and blacklisted numbers.

By adding a number to the blacklist, the number will be blocked and will continue to be blocked as long as the app is runnning in the background.

By adding a number to the whitelist, the number will be allowed to call you when other calls are barred.

There are 2 additional buttons, to accept ALL calls and to reject ALL calls.

We also put an emeregency call number, so that it'll make an emergency call when needed.

The UI sucks. Yes it really does suck. But that's all we could come up with in 3 hours.

I'll definitly come back to the app soon and fix up the XML design and UI. But till then enjoy and hope this proves to be useful!
